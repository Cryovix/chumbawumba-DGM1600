It must have been 100 stories tall and each floor was both a different color and design than the floors below. Fascinated by the place I walked right through the front door not bothering to read signs or listen to what was happening around me.\n\n Once inside I walked right up to the service desk and found an unusually tall man standing there watching me.

I checked my key to find one side had the number thirteen etched into it and the other side had a picture of a wolf. The elevator seemed to stop as soon as I finished looking over the key, which was odd, and once again tall guy, whom I mentally named Lars, just pointed out of the elevator. Taking a deep breath I stepped out into a long hallway.\n\n The lights on this floor were a bit crazy. They gave off a silvery gleam that made the depictions of creatures on the wall move. Still I was so excited I rushed down the hallway found a door with both a 13 and a wolf on it and I went to unlock it.

The floors, walls, ceilings, and furnishings were all made of wood. Some of the pieces had some intricate work put into them too! I looked everywhere: In things, under things, around things, my pockets...there was no animal in the room.
